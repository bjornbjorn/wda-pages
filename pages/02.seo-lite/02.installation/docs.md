>>> Note, these docs are for ExpressionEngine 3! Legacy (EE2) documentation can be [found here](http://ee2.wedoaddons.com).

Unzip the downloaded zip and place the 'seo_lite' folder in **/system/user/addons/**.

In the ExpressionEngine Control Panel navigate to the Add-On Manager and click "Install" next to "SEO Lite" in the list of add ons.

That's it!

After installing SEO Lite all your entries will have an additional **Publish Tab** called "SEO Lite" (note that you can rename this in your config).
