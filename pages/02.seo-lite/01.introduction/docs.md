SEO Lite is the easiest way to make sure the title-tag is output on all pages
on your site: one global layout / embed / snippet and you're done. SEO Lite is a very
lightweight module which will add a SEO tab to your publish page.

It has an editable template that can be embedded in the header of your site.

Using only one database query it should be perfect for high traffic sites.
