SEO Lite supports Multiple Site Manager. To get it to work simply switch to the new site, navigate to the SEO Lite settings and save them on the new site. Every site has its specific settings / template.

Note; if you are pulling content from site_1 in a template on site_2 for instance you'll need to pass site_id="1" to SEO Lite for it to find the content (it will default to the current site_id).
